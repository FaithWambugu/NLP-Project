# NLP-Sentiment Analysis 

## üìùOverview
This project's goal is to build an Natural Language Processing model to analyze tweets' sentiments about Apple and Google products from Twitter, now X, and rate them as either positive, negatve or neutral.
The data comes from CrowdFlower via [data.world](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions) and contains over 9000 tweets.

## üí°Business Understanding
In the recent years, the global smartphone market remained highly competitive, with major brands such as Apple and Google continuing to dominate innovation and customer engagement discussions online. However, third-party tech distributors, who rely on these brands' public image to drive sales, often lack accessible tools to automatically analyze global customer sentiment. This limitation makes it difficult for them to gauge market trends, anticipate product reception, or adjust inventory and marketing strategies in real time.
By performing sentiment analysis on tweets related to Apple and Google products, this project aims to provide real-time insights into how consumers perceive these brands, enabling distributors to make data-driven decisions that align with evolving market sentiments.
