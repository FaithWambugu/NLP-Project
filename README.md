## **Real-Time Sentiment Monitoring for Tech Distributors**

This project leverages **Transfer Learning** with the **DistilBERT** model to provide third-party technology distributors with critical, real-time insights into public sentiment towards Apple and Google products. The primary goal is to establish a robust alerting system by maximizing the detection of negative customer feedback.

Our final model achieved an exceptional **$90\%$ Recall** on the Negative sentiment class, ensuring that the highest-risk tweets are flagged immediately for business action.

### üí° Business Context & Motivation

Third-party distributors operate in a high-stakes, competitive environment where product perception dictates sales and inventory strategy. They currently lack accessible tools for automated, large-scale sentiment analysis, leaving them vulnerable to market shifts and slow to react to customer dissatisfaction.

This solution bridges that gap by transforming unstructured social media data into **actionable intelligence**, enabling distributors to:

  * **Prevent Missed Warnings:** Proactively address potential product issues or widespread customer frustration.
  * **Optimize Inventory:** Align stocking decisions with real-time brand perception.
  * **Inform Marketing:** Adjust campaigns and messaging based on evolving public opinion.

-----

###  Key Technical Features

The solution employs a hybrid modeling approach to serve both alerting and strategic analysis needs:

1.  **Binary Classification (Alerting Core):**
      * **Goal:** High Recall for the Negative class (0.90 achieved).
      * **Model:** **DistilBERT** fine-tuned on the Negative vs. Positive classes.
2.  **Multiclass Classification (Strategic Trends):**
      * **Goal:** Contextual insight into all sentiment types (Negative, Neutral, Positive).
      * **Model:** **DistilBERT** fine-tuned on the three sentiment classes.
3.  **Advanced Handling of Imbalance:**
      * **Technique:** Combination of **Data Augmentation** (Synonym Replacement) and a custom **Focal Loss** function were implemented to effectively address the severe class imbalance, surpassing the performance of traditional SMOTE/Class Weights.

### üìä Performance Summary

The Deep Learning approach decisively outperformed the classical Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) across all key metrics.

| Model | Classification Task | Negative Recall | Macro F1-Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DistilBERT** | **Binary (Alerting)** | $\mathbf{0.90}$ | $\mathbf{0.89}$ |
| **DistilBERT** | Multiclass (Trends) | $0.82$ | $0.69$ |
| **XGBoost** | Binary (ML Champion) | $0.57$ | $0.73$ |

### üíª How to Run the Project

The core project output is the interactive Streamlit dashboard.

#### **1. Prerequisites**

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** and a package manager (`pip` or `conda`).

#### **2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FaithWambugu/NLP-Project.git
cd <repository_name>
```

#### **3. Set Up the Environment**

Install all required dependencies, including PyTorch and the Hugging Face libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **4. Launch the Streamlit Application**

The application provides the final deployed solution, visualizing binary alerts and multiclass trends.

```bash
streamlit run sentiment_app.py
```

#### **5. View the Full Analysis**

All data cleaning, EDA, ML, and DL modeling steps are fully documented in the main Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

*(Open the main notebook file and run the cells in sequence.)*

### üîç Data Source & Structure

  * **Source:** CrowdFlower Brands and Product Emotions dataset, available via `data.world`.
  * **Total Records:** Over 9,000 tweets.
  * **Key Columns:**
      * `tweet_text`: The raw text for analysis.
      * `emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at`: The specific brand or product.
      * `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product`: The original sentiment label (Positive, Negative, No emotion).
