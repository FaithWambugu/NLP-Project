    "# Sentimental Analysis of Apple and Google Tweets for Third-Party Tech Distributors\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "In the recent years, the global smartphone market remained highly competitive, with major brands such as Apple and Google continuing to dominate innovation and customer engagement discussions online.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, third-party tech distributors, who rely on these brands' public image to drive sales, often lack accessible tools to automatically analyze global customer sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation makes it difficult for them to gauge market trends, anticipate product reception, or adjust inventory and marketing strategies in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing sentiment  analysis on tweets related to Apple and Google products, this project aims to provide real-time insights into how consumers perceive these brands, enabling distributors to make data-driven decisions that align with evolving market sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Challenges Faced by Third-Party Distributors\n",
    "1. Limited visibility into global public sentiments towards the products they sell(Apple, Google).\n",
    "2. Dependence on manual research and online reviews that are often outdated  or subjective.\n",
    "3. Difficulty identifying sentiment trends after major product releases or controversies\n",
    "4. Lack of predictive insights to guide marketing, stock, and pricing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "1. **Third-Party Distributors and Retailers**: Rely on sentiment data to understand market perception, adjust marketing and manage pproduct portifolios.\n",
    "2. **Marketing Teams**: Monitor shifts in brand sentiments to align promotions or partnerships.\n",
    "3. **Product Analysts**: Track performance of specific products and flag potential reputation risks.\n",
    "4. **Executive Leadership**: Use sentiment trends to guide strategic product stocking and investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Third-party tech distributors play a crucial role in connecting manufacturers like Apple and Google with global consumers. However, these distributors often lack accessible, domain-specific sentiment analysis tools that can automatically monitor and interpret public opinions about the products they sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, many rely on manual market research, delayed reports, or fragmented feedback to understand customer attitudes, limiting their ability to make timely, data-driven decisions about marketing, inventory, and partnerships.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to bridge the gap by:\n",
    "1. Developing an NLP-based sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets about Apple and Google products as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "2. Deploying the model in a user-friendly web application that provides real-time sentiment insights.\n",
    "3. Empowering distributors to track brand perception, respond quickly to market trends, and make more informed business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. To build an NLP model capable of classifying tweets into sentiment categories(positive, negative, neutral)\n",
    "2. To identify sentiment patterns and trends across brands(Apple vs Gooogle)\n",
    "3. To deploy a user-friendly Streamlit web application for real-time sentiment monitoring.\n",
    "4. To generate insights that support distributors' marketing, pricing and inventory strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics of Success\n",
    "This project will be considered successful if:\n",
    "1. The trained model achieves reliable performance on unseen test data.\n",
    "2. Sentiment predctions are interpretable and align with human-labeled examples.\n",
    "3. Business insights are actionable and understandable to non-technical users\n",
    "4. The Streamit app runs smoothly, with:\n",
    "   - Accuracy score >= 80% on test data\n",
    "   - F1-Score >= 0.80 for sentiment classification\n",
    "   - User-friendly dashboard summarizing key results"

    "## Data Understanding \n",
    "To analyze consumer sentiments toward Apple and Google products, we are using the **CrowdFlower Brands and Product Emotions** dataset, sourced from **data.world**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains **9,093 Tweets** collected from Twitter now X, where human annotators labeled whether each tweet expresses an emotion directed at a specific brand or product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides a reliable foundation for developing a Natural Language Processing(NLP) model capable of understanding how consumers express opinions about major technology brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of the dataset and its structure:\n",
    "1. `tweet_text` : The raw text of the tweet. This is the primary input used for sentiment classification and NLP modeling.\n",
    "2. `emotion_in_tweet_is directed_at` : The specific brand or product that the tweet's refer to. This column helps identify relevant tweets for Apple and Google.\n",
    "3. `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product`: The sentiment label assogned to the tweet, indicating the emotional polarity expressed towards the mentioned brand. It can either be **Positive emotion, Negative emotion**, and sometimes **No emotion**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Summary\n",
    "1. **Total Records**: 9,093 tweets\n",
    "2. **Columns**: 3\n",
    "3. **Target Variable**: `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product`\n",
    "4. **Missing Values**: Some Tweets do not specify a brand or product under `emotion_in_tweet_is directed_at`\n",
    "5. **Data Type**: All features are stored as object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Relevance\n",
    "This dataset is highly relevant because it captures authentic, user-generated opinions about real-world products and brands. For third-party tech distributors, such insights are critical for:\n",
    "1. Understanding consumer perception trends for Apple and Google Products.\n",
    "2. Tracking how positive or negative sentiments shift after major product releases or events.\n",
    "3. Supporting data-driven marketing and stocking decisions aligned with brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this dataset provides a solid basis for building and deploying a sentiment analysis application that empowers distributors to monitor brand perception and respond to shifts in consumer sentiments in real time."
